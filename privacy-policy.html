								<li class="my-4">
									<h5>How We Collect Your data</h5>
									<p>Likely situations when you make personal data available to Servicito include, but are not limited to: (i) by using
										Servicito’s mobile apps or visiting our websites, (ii) registration for Services, contests and special events; (iii)
										accessing Services using a third party ID, such as social networking sites or gaming services; (iv) subscribing to
										newsletters; (v) purchasing a product or services through Servicito’s online stores or within the app (or "in-app
										purchase"); (vi) using "tell a friend," "email this page," or other similar features; (vii) requesting technical
										support; and (viii) otherwise through use of Servicito Services where personal data is required for use and/or participation.</p>
									<p>The data we process on you may include, but is not limited to: email address, device ID, IP-address, usernames and
										passwords. </p>
									<p>Servicito may supplement your data with data received from third parties in connection with demographic, advertisement,
										market and other analytics surveys or services. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="my-4">
									<h5>Advertising Serving Technology</h5>
									<p>Servicito reserves the right to use and disclose the collected, non-personal data for purposes of advertising by Servicito
										or Servicito’s partners and contractors. </p>
									<p>Servicito may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result
										of ad serving through Services. </p>
									<p>Servicito or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and geo-location information (for
										more information regarding use of Location Data see below Section 3) as well as information logged from your hardware
										or device to ensure that relevant advertising is presented within the Service. Servicito or third parties may collect
										and use data, for such purposes, including but not limited to, data such as IP address, Device ID, MAC address, installed
										software, application usage data, hardware type, Operating System information, browser information, unique identifiers
										in browser cookies, Flash cookies, and HTML5 local storage, Internet and on-line usage information and in-game information.

										providing the ad serving technology.</p>
									<p>Servicito may display to you behaviorally targeted advertising. If you wish to "opt out" of certain targeted advertising,
										please visit related sites of those advertisements. Please note that the links above may not reach all Servicito’s
										advertising partners and certain behaviorally targeted advertising may still be displayed to you. If you want to
										be certain that no behaviorally targeted advertisements are displayed to you, please do not use or access the Services.</p>
									<p>Some services may include the use of in-game advertisements or brand placement. Such ads or sponsorships will be noted
										as such within the services.</p>
									<p>Additionally please note that if you "opt out" it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just
										means that the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant
										to you.</p>
								</li>
						
								<li class="my-4">

										that is required for the provision of the location related Services.</p>
									<p>Servicito may use, depending on the service (1)IP-based location based on the IP address presented by the end-user,
										(2) fine geo-location data based on coordinates obtained from a mobile device’s GPS radio, or (3) coarse, network-based
										geo-location data based on proximity of network towers or the location of WiFi networks.</p>
									<p>Your fine, GPS-based geo-location is not accessed without your consent. Notwithstanding Servicito’s partners who are
										providing location related parts of the Service, Servicito will not share your GPS geo-location with third parties
										without your consent. To the extent Servicito makes available GPS geo-location to third parties in accordance with
										this Privacy Policy, it will be provided anonymously.</p>

									<p>Please note that certain features of the Services may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain
										additional information about you. In such cases, Servicito may be able to collect certain information from your social
										networking profile when your social networking site permits it, and when you consent to allow your social networking

									<p>Cookies: A "cookie" is a small file stored by your browser when told to do so by a website. Typically websites place
										a number of different cookies on an end-user’s machine. Some of the cookies are "1st Party," from the website itself,
										and others are "3rd party," belonging to advertising and analytics entities or social networks. Servicito’s cookies
										do not include personal data and are typically used to quickly identify your device and to "remember" your browser
										during subsequent visits for purposes of functionality, preferences, and website performance. You can disable cookies
										or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect
										your ability to use the Services. </p>

										are small files similar to browser cookies, but which are not stored in the browser and can also be used to remember
										your settings, to personalize the look and feel of the Services, or for advertising and analytics. You may prevent
										Flash cookies from being stored by following the instructions provided by Adobe at
										<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>
									</p>
									<p>Web Beacons and pixel tags: A "web beacon" or a "pixel tag" is an electronic image (often not visible to the end-user)
										that allows Servicito to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Additionally,
										e-mails and other electronic communications Servicito sends to you may contain pixel tags that enable Servicito to
										track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed,
										if any. </p>
								</li>
						
								<li class="my-4">

										and Servicito is not liable for any such third parties’ use of your personal data. </p>
									<p>Certain Services that Servicito may offer, such as multiplayer gaming, social networking and gaming console services,
										may use third party services to provide authentication for the Services with a gaming console ID, social networking
										ID, or gaming network account. In connection with such use, certain personally identifiable user and/or membership
										data may be transferred automatically to and from Servicito. </p>
									<p>Servicito may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring,
										the sale of substantially all of Servicito’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation,
										during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern
										such personal data. </p>
								</li>
						
								<li class="my-4">
									<h5>Safeguards</h5>
									<p>Servicito follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the
										security, integrity and privacy of the information in Servicito’s possession. </p>
								</li>
						
								<li class="my-4">
									<h5>Other</h5>
									<p>You may choose to disclose data about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to the Services.</p>
									<p> Any data that you disclose in any of these forums, blogs, chats or the like will become public information, and there
										is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality with respect to that data. </p>
									<p> Servicito may store and/or transfer your personal data to its affiliates and partners in and outside of EU/EEA member
										states and the United States in accordance with mandatory legislation and this Privacy Policy. </p>
								</li>
						
								<li class="my-4">
									<h5>Payments</h5>
									<p>Servicito does not guarantee your payments or any kind of transactions to be made by certain. All of the payments/transactions
										to the users will be made by the app developer/company/owner who use our service to determine the actual amount of
										transactions and as a service provider we do not take any responsibility of any kind of transactions made by our
										users. We let our users (developers/companies/product owners) to determine the amount of the transactions to be made,

									<h5>Special Note about Children’s Privacy </h5>
									<p>Servicito does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If Servicito learns
										that Servicito has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 years of age, Servicito will take
										reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal data from Servicito’s records. </p>
									<p>Servicito understands the need to provide extra privacy protections to users who are children. To that end, features
										and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviorally targeted advertising, and collection of data for the
										purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13. Servicito also does not allow our third party
										partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13. </p>
									<p>Servicito and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection
										of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features served comply with applicable laws of
										that nation.</p>
									<p>Servicito and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number
										of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are popular. Servicito also uses this
										data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly,
										and to allow users to personalize their experience on the site or service (for example, to save a high score in a
										game). Servicito and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based
										identifiers, and software-set identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.</p>
									<p>Please note that Servicito’s partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and
										ad-serving purposes. While Servicito requires that companies comply with Servicito’s privacy policy before Servicito
										allows those companies to access our sites and services, Servicito does not actually control third-party data collection
										and use. Servicito encourages parents to review the list of operators below and to become familiar with those parties
										policies and practices. </p>
									<p>If you have additional questions about Servicito’s Privacy Practices related to children under the age of 13, please
										contact us at
										<strong> info@Servicito.com</strong>
									</p>
								</li>
						
								<li class="my-4">
									<h5>Further information </h5>
									<p>Servicito makes good faith efforts to enable you to review, update or correct your personal data in Servicito’s possession.</p>
									<p>Servicito will need sufficient information from you to establish your identity and to verify your access request, and
										also to assist us in handling your request. </p>
